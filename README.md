# TIC-TAG-TOE-GAME
A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe (Noughts and Crosses) game. Built using [insert language , e.g., HTML,CSS, JavaScript, etc.], this project allows two players to take turns placing their marks (X and O) on a 3Ã—3 grid. The game checks for win conditions, handles draws, and includes a clean, user-friendly interface.
